We provide the interface to many desciptors.
- `RDF`: Radius distance distribution function
- `ADF`: Bond angle distribution function
- `DDF`: Dihedral angle distribution function
- `Chem`: element dependent dependent chemical labels, inspired by the method used in Jarvis-ML
- `Charge`: element dependent charges, inspired by the method used in Jarvis-ML
- `Voronoi`: the Voronoi tessellation of crystal structure, proposed by Ward et at in Phys. Rev. B, 96, 024104 (2017)
