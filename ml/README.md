We provide the interface to many ML algorithms.
- KNN
- KRR
- Random Forest
- SVM
- Gradient Boosting
- LASSO
- KNN

Typically, one needs to explore the parameter space for each algorithm in order to achieve the best performance. 
Therefore, we provide three sets of trainings to different algorithm.
- `light`: typically just use the default parameters provided by the ML algorithm.
- `medium`: 
- `tight`: Grid search for the optimal parameters
